# Asteroids

Boot.Dev guided project to build a clone of the classic Asteroids game using Pygame and object-oriented programming concepts.\
This project teaches how to use Pygame to create a game loop, handle user input, and manage game state. It also shows how to use object-oriented programming to create game objects and manage their interactions.
